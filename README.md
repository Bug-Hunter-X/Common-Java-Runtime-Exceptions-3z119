This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates how to handle several common runtime exceptions. The program includes examples of ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and InterruptedException, along with appropriate try-catch blocks to handle them.  This is useful for understanding exception handling in Java and preventing unexpected program termination.
