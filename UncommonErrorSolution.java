The provided code already includes robust exception handling.  Each potential exception (ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, InterruptedException) is caught in a try-catch block, preventing the program from crashing.  To improve it further, you could add more specific error messages or logging to help debug the issue. For example, you could log the stack trace or include more details about the error in the exception message.
